# assembly_lab
all assignments are made as a simulation for MSP460 CPU  
lab1 - creates the array identical_indices_amount. identical_indices_amount[i] = num of identical bits between the valuse of id1[i] and id2[i] (16 bits representation).

lab2 - creates Parity1 from id1 and Parity2 from id2 which contains 1 if id[i] is odd and 0 if id[i] is even. 

using stack memmory

lab3 - 
     
     switch 1 is on :counting up with leds from 0x00 to 0xff, 1 sec delay	
	
     switch 2 is on : counting down with leds from 0xff to 0x00, 1 sec delay	
	
     switch 4 is on : Present id1 and then id2 on leds with 1 sec delay	
     
lab4 - (PB push/pull botton) 

	PB0 - counting down with leds from 0xff to 0x00, 0.5 sec delay, with 10 sec cycle, saves last leds state on repush
	
	PB1 - turnung on one lef at a time with 0.5 delay, for 5 sec cycle, saves last leds state on repush
	
	PB2 - create PMW in P2.7, with 75% DC and and frequency of 2.5KHz
	
	sleep mode when nothing is pushed and no active cycle 
	
lab5 - using timerA in MSP 
	
	PB0 - 2 min alert ,countng up from 00:00 to 02:00 in LCD screen
	
	pb1 - use input capture function in timerA, tic func capture start of code section , and toc capture end of code section. print to LCD the code section run time 
	
lab6 - using oscillator to create shape signals
	
	PB0 - samples the signal and print to LCD screen the reconstructed shape (sine/triangle/PWM)
	
	PB1 - prints to LCD the average power of the current signal, every 32 samples
