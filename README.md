# assembly_lab
all assignments are made as a simulation for MSP460 CPU  
lab1 - creates the array identical_indices_amount. identical_indices_amount[i] = num of identical bits between the valuse of id1[i] and id2[i] (16 bits representation).

lab2 - creates Parity1 from id1 and Parity2 from id2 which contains 1 if id[i] is odd and 0 if id[i] is even.

lab3 - switch 1 is on :Leds counting upwards from #0 to #0xFF, 1 sec delay
       switch 2 is on : Leds counting downwards from #0xFF to #0, 1 sec delay
       switch 4 is on : Present id1 and then id2 on leds with 1 sec delay
